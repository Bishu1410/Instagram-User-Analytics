# Instagram-User-Analytics
Here we are trying to build a system through which we will be able to
build better business opportunities and better client interaction.
Through this user analytics we will measure certain parameters which
in turn will help us grow as a company and also most certainly help in
understanding our users. By this way we would also be able to
recommend best of our services to our users. These users analytics are
the foundation pillar of the success of any organisation. All the
activities performed by users, like and dislikes of users every minute
detail is paid attention and hence helps in creating a best possible
service to the users.
In this project we are going to work out with a
dataset of instagram users which contains various parameters such as
registering on the app, liking a photo, using hashtags etc. With all
these provided data we would try to derive the outcomes desired from
us.
